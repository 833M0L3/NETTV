# Nepali IPTV Apps for AndroidTVs

These apps are free to download on the Android TV Play Store and optimized for remote control use on Android TV or set-top boxes with Android OS. For users with uncertified boxes running the standard Android OS (like tablet versions), this page offers APKs for easy sideloading. Unlike Android TV, which has a special Play Store for remote-friendly apps, uncertified devices lack access to these TV-optimized apps, requiring manual installation.

::: tip
If the apps don't appear on your home menu, then make sure to install different launcher. Personally I would recommend installing Projectivity Launcher.
