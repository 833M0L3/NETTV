Bypassing means your box allows you to install or sideload any apps you like. For some complicated legal reasons NETTV has always locked down it's early NETTV boxes. The default launcher in these boxes are riddled with unskippable video ads and ads banner.

Also, when your NETTV subscription is over, you can't even use the box for Youtube and other stuffs. When the box is bypassed, you will be able to load your own launcher, Youtube apps, skip ads, so on. You will be able to use other sideloaded apps while still being subscribed to the NETTV.

## Compatibility

These bypass methods presented in this documentation work on specific firmware versions. So make sure that your box has the supported firmware. To check your firmware version goto settings and about. The firmware version code format are in hexadecimal and they look like these : ``020F07`` ``020A07`` . In the system settings they are shown as build version.
