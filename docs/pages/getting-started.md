Since the launch of IPTV in 2016 by NETTV, it has been dominating the TV market. Because of its many features and capabilities, NETTV has revolutionized how we used to view Television. Over the years, NETTV as a brand has come through many changes. As of now, Worldlink Communications owns it. The ISP is known for its restrictive methods, as it doesn't allow router access to its customers. The same thing is done on the setup box they are using for the NETTV.

Over the past years since 2016, NETTV has gone through many transitions. The setup boxes they used for the IPTV has also been revamped and changed multiple times. This site will keep track of every setup boxes that the NETTV has used in the past and present.

The main goal of this site is to provide information about the existing NETTV setup boxes and their uses.
