# Bypassing Worldlink's NETTV Setup box restriction to install 3rd party android apps
![Setupbox](/setupbox.jpg)

This works on NETTV White Setup box. Dunno about other models.

# Things you will need
* A Redmi Phone with IR Blaster ( This is very important and is one of the most crucial part of this method, without this I don't think it is possible)
* PC with ADB setup ( Google to learn how to setup adb on Windows or any OS )
* NETTV Setup Box ( Ofcourse )

# Procedure
First let's explain what we are going to do. We are going to use the IR Blaster of the Redmi Phone to control the NETTV Setup Box. With the Mi Remote app that is built in on the phone we are going to use it to open system settings on NETTV. Once we open the system settings , we will enable the Developer Option and enable USB Debugging mode, then use it to install 3rd party apps on the Setup Box.

* Inorder for the Mi Remote to get the right keymap, we need to set the phone's region to India. To do that, simply go to Settings of the phone and navigate to Additional Settings and there should be an option to let you change the region. Set it to India. 
* Once it's done, clear the date of Mi Remote App if it's already installed, if it's not installed on your phone then download it from the play store.
* Now open the Mi Remote App and select Setup Box, inside there you should see tons of company names.

* Look for **Home Digital** and select it
* A new menu will come up with virtual power button. Point your phone towards NETTV Setup Box and press the button. That should open the system settings on your TV Box.
